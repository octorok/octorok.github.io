Hi! I'm Chris Smith. Actually, not _the_ Chris Smith. Just _a_ Chris Smith. Anyways, this is my new blog.

I am the founder of [Puppy Warrior Studios](www.puppy-warrior.com "Puppy Warrior Studios"). It's a fly-by-night game development shop specializing in small, niche titles.

Over time I'm sure I'll go into my motiviation for starting the company, our first project, and my own journey in mastering Unity3D. But for now, I just wanted to say "hello".
