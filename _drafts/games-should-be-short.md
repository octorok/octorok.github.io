Games should short. I'll waste a few hundred words underlining that point, but that's all you need to know.

There are several reasons why the game industry is dying:

- Flooded with games (indies like Puppy Warrior!)
- To little innovation for AAA companies.

In my humble opionion, the only way for the industry to survive is to continue to maximize player fun. The App Stores of the world having more variety is great, but at the end of the day there are only so many players and so many disposable hours.

This is one reason why I am so worried about the rise of freeimum / free-to-play. _Clash of Clans_ is a fun game, I spent more hours on it than I would like to admit. But if that consumes X-hundred hours per player, that prevents them from trying out other games.

So the conflict is the relationship between games-as-a-service (freemium) and players tring out more games.
